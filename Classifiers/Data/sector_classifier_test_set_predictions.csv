"Avril; The Avril Group was born of a collective approach. It was created in 1983 at the initiative of French farmers in order to develop the national production of oilseeds (rapeseed, sunflower, olive, soybean, etc.) and protein crops (pea, field bean, lupin, etc.).

By federating all actors in these sectors and developing markets for their production, in almost 40 years Avril has become a major industrial and financial group.

Today it is present in France and internationally (where it generates 46% of its turnover) in sectors that as diversified as they are intimately linked: human foods, animal nutrition and expertise and renewable energies and chemistry. In each of these sectors, growth has been based on a portfolio of brands that are leaders in their markets, such as Sanders, Lesieur, Puget, Costa d'Oro, Matines, Oleo100, Diester, Bunica, Taous ...

Avril was built, and still operates, according to an original model: a sectoral organization ‚Äì from grain to the finished product ‚Äì where each activity creates value for all other links in the chain.

To drive this model, the Group draws strength from the complementarity of its activities: industrial activities organized around its plant and animal sectors, and financial activities as an investor via Sofiprot√©ol, its finance and development arm.

The originality of this model makes Avril an unique Group characterized by established collective stakeholders, strong agricultural and territorial roots and the systematic reinvestment of its profits in the development of all the national sectors in which it operates.

In 2020, the Avril Group achieved sales of 5.8 billion euros. It has 7,571 employees in 19 countries.

"Soletair Power; We turn buildings into carbon sinks.

Our patented onsite carbon capture technology empowers commercial property owners to cut their buildings' overall carbon emissions while earning them significant cost savings. The modular carbon capture systems operate with a plug-and-play approach, enabling property owners to rapidly and easily install onsite carbon capture solutions.

Each HVAC-integrated DAC unit (in buildings with ventilation of 3 m¬≥/s) can capture up to 20 tons of CO2 per year, equivalent to 3 hectares of Nordic forest aged 30 years. If building ventilation runtime is controlled by CO2 levels, the system will also help lower the costs of HVAC energy usage.

The technology is safe and economically sustainable, providing a two-way benefit with a low water, heat, electricity, and material footprint. We can also add particle and fume filters. When the captured CO2 is stored or used in making aggregates, it results in long-term sequestration. When using renewable energy, the process is carbon-negative.

Captured CO2 can act as a non-fossil-based resource in many applications, for example, in making polymers, methanol, fuel, food, and even diamonds. The cyclic use thus effectively rewinds the pathway of fossil-based CO2.

In 2021, together with W√§rtsil√§, we demonstrated making fuel from thin air at Expo 2020 Dubai. In 2022, we delivered a fully operating outdoor CO2 capturing unit to ZBT, Duisburg, Germany.

EOS Climate was founded in 2009 by Jeff Cohen, Todd English and Joe Madden who were MBA classmates at Presidio Graduate School. Their business plan, subsequently financed by Firelake Capital, was to leverage carbon markets to incentivize destruction of CFCs (ozone-depleting refrigerants) recovered from older refrigeration and air conditioning equipment and building infrastructure.
 
The EOS team built a world-class group of operating partners and to date has delivered over 4.5 million metric tonnes of verified emissions reductions in the North American markets. EOS has become the market leader and premier global producer of high-quality, verified emission reductions generated from the destruction of refrigerants/ozone depleting substances (ODS).

Leveraging this unique experience enabled the EOS team to identify broader opportunities to address climate challenges presented by refrigerant emissions and a new methodology was developed for incentivizing the use of recycled HFCs and advanced refrigeration systems.

EOS will continue to develop its suite of market-based climate change solutions to address the impact of commodities beyond refrigerants.

"LanzaTech; It‚Äôs not a debate. There‚Äôs no two sides. 
A post-pollution world is inevitable.
Humans will either be part of it, or the planet will go on without us.
In other words, it‚Äôs defossilize or die. But where others see a dire choice, LanzaTech sees a trillion-dollar opportunity.
The good news is after 15 years, north of a thousand patents, 
and millions of hours of pioneering scientific inquiry, LanzaTech has invented a technology big enough to meet the moment. One that transforms pollution into profit, and ensures that  humans continue to prosper far into the post-pollution future.
The science is state-of-the-art, but the idea is simple. 
We use nature to heal nature. First we capture carbon emissions. Then we feed them into bioreactors where trillions of carbon-hungry microbes go to work. These tiny dynamos eat the pollution and output valuable raw material commodities. Pure enough to be resold, repurposed, recycled, renewed, re-everythinged ‚Äî from sustainable jet fuel to yoga pants.

It‚Äôs a commercial scale solution that‚Äôs ready for market today. In a crowded sector filled with speculation but short on results, our plug-and-play platform is already making our customers money. Turns out science and business makes one helluva team.
Waste carbon pollution is humanity‚Äôs biggest threat. 
LanzaTech is turning it into an opportunity. Reducing emissions and making money for our customers ‚Äî today. 
Let's transform our tired Lose-Lose climate debate into a Win-Win proposition. One that helps companies grow their revenue while helping the planet reach a post-pollution reality.
