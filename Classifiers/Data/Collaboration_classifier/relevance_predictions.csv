The trial commenced in October and has successfully operated for 1,000 hours, meeting performance requirements in terms of hydrogen production, electrical efficiency and reliability.

CSIRO’s SOE technology uses both waste heat (for example, steam from the steelworks) and electricity to produce hydrogen with greater efficiency.  

CSIRO spinout Hadean Energy has licensed the technology and is also testing the long term durability and performance of the modular design at CSIRO’s Hydrogen Technology Demonstration Facility.

"A great read fromThe Vancouver Sunabout Carbon Engineering’s decision to expand the capacity of our first commercial Direct Air Capture plant design. The expansion – from a plant capable of capturing 500,000 tons of atmospheric CO2 to an expected one million tons of CO2 each year – comes in response to increased corporate interest in achieving carbon neutrality.“What we provide is a mechanism for a company to remove as much of its carbon footprint as it wants,” said Steve Oldham, CEO of CE. “We’re essentially providing a service, much like water treatment, sanitation or waste disposal. But instead, we’re providing an air-treatment service that removes the excess CO2 in the atmosphere, which the scientists tell us is putting our planet at risk.”Full story below.",0

"“Finding ways to reduce near-term demand can help alleviate the strain on the grid and avoid the additional emissions and climate costs of adding new fossil fuel generation, especially given the long wait times for adding new wind and solar projects to the grid,” said Andrea Staid, principal technical leader at EPRI. 

“The typical system response might be to build more generation to meet those loads. ... There's a lot of costs with that,” she said, including fossil fuel emissions that will only warm the planet further. Alternative resources on the demand side can help balance the system in the near term, she said.

“I think that's important to keep in mind going forward and when we are struggling to build generation quickly — especially renewable generation,” she said.
