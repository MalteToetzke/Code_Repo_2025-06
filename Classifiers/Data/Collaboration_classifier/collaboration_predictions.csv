This flagship event brought together Taiwan’s leading sustainability practitioners, including CHIMEI Corporation, China Steel Corporation, and ASE Holdings, all of whom took centre stage to share their best practices and commitment to a low-carbon future.

At this year’s forum, Evercomm, in collaboration with Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)(工業技術研究院, 工研院) and CTBC, pre-launched an enhanced suite of end-to-end decarbonisation tools. A key highlight of this launch was the introduction of new features specifically designed for managing financed emission portfolios, empowering financial institutions (FIs) like CTBC to more effectively support and manage emissions reduction efforts across their lending portfolios.

Evercomm’s software tools enable FIs to play a pivotal role in guiding their clients towards a low-carbon future. By providing features that accurately measure, track, and simulate carbon footprint reduction activities and their environmental and financial impacts, FIs can now offer targeted support, helping businesses implement tangible decarbonisation strategies. 

As corporate sustainability and decarbonisation demands grow, Evercomm remains committed to providing businesses and FIs with world-class solutions to meet their carbon reduction and sustainability objectives.

It was an honour to participate in this flagship event, contributing to Taiwan’s green finance and industrial transformation. Together with CTBC and ITRI, Evercomm is dedicated to helping businesses, FIs and cities embrace a new era of sustainable growth.

💬 A #discussion session followed, focusing on building a hydrogen network and addressing regional #vocational needs. 💡Industry participants expressed great interest in the H2CoVE project, acknowledging the importance of preparing for the emerging hydrogen market.

🌟 H2CoVE (Hydrogen Centres of Vocational Excellence) aims to equip the European workforce with the right and necessary high-quality vocational skills for industries in the emerging value chains for a #HydrogenEconomy in 5 European regions - Austria, Estonia, Ukraine, and the Netherlands. The project is funded by the European Union.

🤝 FEN Research GmbH represents Tyrol, Austria, as the regional coordinator in this project. Our regional partners: FEN Sustain Systems GmbH, klasse!forschung, FH Kufstein Tirol – University of Applied Sciences, and #HTLKramsach Glas und Chemie.
