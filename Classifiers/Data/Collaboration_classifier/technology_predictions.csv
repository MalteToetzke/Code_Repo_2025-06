Â 
Vortexâ€™s waste-to-energy story, while complex, is also relatively simple â€“ weâ€™re converting the process heat that industrial processes generate and release into the environment into usable clean energy â€“ reducing carbon emissions, increasing the supply of electricity, reducing costs, and increasing processing plant efficiency. Thereâ€™s still a long way to go and many more challenges to overcome, but thatâ€™s the nature of deep tech and as the Sunday story will tell, by tackling some fundamental problems facing our future, successful commercialisation of deep tech delivers an outsized impact.

The confirmation from the UK Government on 20th February â€“ known as a Section 35 direction â€“ is an important step in the planning and consenting programme for CCS at Ferrybridge, with statutory consultation due to take place later this year ahead of the submission of an application for Development Consent to the Planning Inspectorate in late 2025.

The Direction from the Secretary of State notes that the proposal â€œwould provide and support the decarbonisation of the largest energy from waste site in the UK, with the potential to deliver over a million tonnes of CO2 savings per annum, equating to 6.5% of the governmentâ€™s annual carbon capture and storage ambition.â€

However, integrating these new technologies presents both safety and logistical challenges.

Recently, a large battery was successfully installed at Copenhagen Airports A/S, which serves as a demonstration airport for the EU project ALIGHT.
â€“ Developing fire and smoke, data leaks, and legal issues are some of the risks and barriers associated with setting up a battery in an airport environment. Therefore, we are pleased to contribute to specifying the battery system and conducting safety tests, which have enabled the battery to be approved and installed at Copenhagen Airport, says Lars Overgaard from Teknologisk Institut.

ðŸ”Œ Danish Technological Institute's role in ALIGHT is to establish and future-proof smart energy systems at the airport. Solutions that draw on our knowledge and experience in creating flexible energy systems using renewable energy.

The operational reliability and functionality of the battery have been tested in our EnergyFlexLab. Here, we have tested the control system in a safe environment to minimize the risk of facing issues when the battery is put into use at the airport.

âœˆâ›½ e-fuels Â is another element towards a greener airport in ALIGHT. Earlier in the project, our partners conducted a series of measurements that showed that aircrafts with 34% biofuel in the tank emit 30% fewer ultrafine particles.

We continue to develop and test technologies in ALIGHT, which concludes in 2025. Keep an eye on this page, where we regularly share results and knowledge that pave the way for the future airport. Also, learn more about the project and the partners here: https://lnkd.in/d_U4GjET

As 2024 comes to a close, we are filled with gratitude and optimism for the opportunities this year has broughtâ€”culminating in our participation atÂ COP29 Azerbaijan, a global platform for bold climate action. During this transformative gathering, we had the privilege to engage with some of the worldâ€™s most forward-thinking organisations:
ðŸ’¡Â RMIÂ â€“ With Thomas Koch Blank, we presented SKORPIoN, anÂ e-methanol pilot facility in Namibia- a critical step toward decarbonizing maritime shipping and enabling sustainable green shipping corridors, from biogenic CO2, leveraging Namibia's unique resources and pioneering spirit.
âš¡Â Institute of Energy Economics, Japan - IEEJ Â â€“ Our chat with Professor Tatsuya Terazawa was focused on renewable-based baseload solutions in which #waves and #windcurrents play a big role. As Namibia strives to harness its vast renewable energy potential, these conversations reinforced the importance of innovation and international collaboration in securing reliable, green energy for all
ðŸ”¥Â BURNÂ â€“ We attended the panel discussion by the Global Carbon Council on clean cooking, which is in line with our solution of Clean cooking with low-pressure #green #hydrogen generated from Solar hydrogen panels, which can generate #Carbon #Credits while providing accessible, sustainable cooking alternatives to communities in Africa and beyond, but also learning from Peter Scott and his team.

AtÂ Kaoko Green Energy Solutions (Pty) Ltd, we remain steadfast in advancing renewable energy technologies, fostering sustainability, and contributing meaningfully to the global energy transition.

About the #HorizonEurope project: PYSOLO (PYrolysis of biomass by concentrated SOLar pOwer) offers a solution for both #decarbonisation and #defossilisation by preparing the ground for a fully #renewable process combining concentrated solar power and biomass pyrolysis. Thanks to the use of solar heat in the #pyrolysis process, the production of valuable products bio-oil, biochar and pyrogas can be maximised and the associated CO‚ÇÇ emission minimised. This offers both economic and environmental benefits compared to conventional pyrolysis.

¬†
The latest Energy Charts Report by the Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Solare Energiesysteme ISE reveals a significant shift in Germany's energy landscape. In 2023, the majority of the energy generated came from renewable sources, accounting for over 50% of the total energy mix.
With a current share of 65%, this trend has continued into 2024, highlighting that renewables are now the leading source of energy in Germany. üí™

At BASF Renewable Energy GmbH, we are working tirelessly to support and accelerate this development. Over the past few years we:

‚úÖ Started investing in our own renewable power assets, particularly through joint ventures in large-scale offshore wind farms such as the Hollandse Kust Zuid and Nordlicht projects with Vattenfall. These initiatives provide clean energy to our sites and play a key role in reducing our carbon footprint. üí®

‚úÖ Concluded long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): We purchase green energy from partners, exemplified by our long-term PPA with ENGIE for onshore wind power from Spain. This ensures a diversified and reliable renewable energy supply chain. ü§ù

These achievements demonstrate that we are not just talking about a more renewable future - we are actively shaping it. 
Our aim is clear: We want to contribute to Germany's climate goals and reach our target of becoming #NetZero! üéØ

But where has been the elephant üêò in the room?

There is one thing we can be sure of üëâ biomass is by far today and globally the biggest source for renewable energy (power and heat combined). And not limited to this, biomass is the only sustainable resource for green C (carbon) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) and is indispensable for industries on their way to net zero.

This has been greatly explained by Andrea Ramirez. She drafted in her speech the complexity concerning the petrochemical industry in the port of Rotterdam becoming more sustainable. Without green C or CO2 from biomass waste, hardly achievable.

Valuable biochar produced by SYNCRAFT #reversepowerplants can permanently store CO2 in the form of green carbon and creating negative CO2-emissions. Apart from being used as feed additive or soil substrate, it also has huge potential for the industry: it can be incorporated as technical carbon into concrete, e.g. CarStorCon¬Æ Technologies GmbH; ecoLocked or can become a booster in polymers, e.g. Carboganic; Made of Air.

By incorporating CO2 into products, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced twice. Firstly, as a building block and permanent sink. And secondly, the use of fossil raw materials is reduced by saving the emissions associated with extraction and processing üí™

A recent announcement was made at the most recent COP28 ‚Äòglobal stock take‚Äô, which stated that more and faster action needs to occur in order to combat the climate emergency. This necessity is why BECCS and other large-scale carbon removal projects, are usually viewed as important and critical to the drive focused on combatting the climate emergency. This view is taken due to the aims these projects have, with the most recent one from Drax, stating that it will aim to have the ability to remove a minimum of 6Mt of Co2 from the atmosphere every year.

The article below highlights the immediate response which Drax provided to the carbon industry, once the news from the COP28 meeting was released. It is the large carbon capture projects which have the largest impact on the climate emergency and the article below addresses this topic.

‚úî What is your focus for the fall?
The goal is to reach an investment decision for the full-scale BECCS plant by the end of 2024, therefore the focus for the fall is to secure future revenues in off-take contracts for carbon removals.

‚úî Who is interested in buying carbon removals?
All companies who still have fossil carbon emissions ‚Äì which unfortunately is almost everyone! 

‚úî And why should they buy from Stockholm Exergi?
BECCS is the most cost-efficient technology to generate permanent carbon removals at scale. And among many things, Beccs Stockholm will show unprecedented energy and resource efficiency. 

‚úî And finally ‚Äì what is the best thing about your job?
We are striving to achieve something never done before, and it is for the benefit of the climate. That makes it easy to set the alarm and get up early in the morning!
