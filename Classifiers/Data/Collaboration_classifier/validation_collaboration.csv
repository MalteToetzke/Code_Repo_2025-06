At this year√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s forum, Evercomm, in collaboration with Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)(√•¬∑¬•√¶¬•¬≠√¶≈†‚Ç¨√®¬°‚Äú√ß¬†‚Äù√ß¬©¬∂√©‚Ñ¢¬¢, √•¬∑¬•√ß¬†‚Äù√©‚Ñ¢¬¢) and CTBC, pre-launched an enhanced suite of end-to-end decarbonisation tools. A key highlight of this launch was the introduction of new features specifically designed for managing financed emission portfolios, empowering financial institutions (FIs) like CTBC to more effectively support and manage emissions reduction efforts across their lending portfolios.

Evercomm√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s software tools enable FIs to play a pivotal role in guiding their clients towards a low-carbon future. By providing features that accurately measure, track, and simulate carbon footprint reduction activities and their environmental and financial impacts, FIs can now offer targeted support, helping businesses implement tangible decarbonisation strategies. 

As corporate sustainability and decarbonisation demands grow, Evercomm remains committed to providing businesses and FIs with world-class solutions to meet their carbon reduction and sustainability objectives.

It was an honour to participate in this flagship event, contributing to Taiwan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s green finance and industrial transformation. Together with CTBC and ITRI, Evercomm is dedicated to helping businesses, FIs and cities embrace a new era of sustainable growth.
