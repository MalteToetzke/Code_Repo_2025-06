The company has announced the production of the first Cybertruck at its factory in Texas. While it is unclear from Tesla's tweet whether this marks the start of serial production or if it is another prototype, it is a significant step forward for the highly anticipated electric pickup.Over the past weeks, several prototypes of the Cybertruck were spotted testing on public roads. Tesla aims to produce 375,000 units of the Cybertruck per year. The decision to manufacture the Cybertruck in Texas was confirmed by Tesla in January.Battery supply logistics have been a key factor contributing to the delays. The electric truck will feature Tesla's 4680-format cells, which are currently produced in Freemont, California and also used in the Model Y manufactured at Giga Texas. To meet demand, Tesla may initially source the 4680 battery cells fromPanasonicandLG Energy Solution, as Tesla's own first-generation 4680 cells have not yet achieved the desired energy density.The production of the first Cybertruck is an important milestone for Tesla and the electric vehicle industry.

However, integrating these new technologies presents both safety and logistical challenges. Recently  a large battery was successfully installed at Copenhagen Airports A/S  which serves as a demonstration airport for the EU project ALIGHT. √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Ç¨≈ì Developing fire and smoke  data leaks  and legal issues are some of the risks and barriers associated with setting up a battery in an airport environment. Therefore  we are pleased to contribute to specifying the battery system and conducting safety tests √Ñ‚Äò√Ö¬∫√¢‚Ç¨¬ù√Ö≈° Danish Technological Institute's role in ALIGHT is to establish and future-proof smart energy systems at the airport. Solutions that draw on our knowledge and experience in creating flexible energy systems using renewable energy. The operational reliability and functionality of the battery have been tested in our EnergyFlexLab. Here  we have tested the control system in a safe environment to minimize the risk of facing issues when the battery is put into use at the airport. √É¬¢√Ö‚Ä∫√ÇÀÜ√É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬∫√ã¬ù e-fuels √É‚Äö√Ç¬†is another element towards a greener airport in ALIGHT. Earlier in the project  our partners conducted a series of measurements that showed that aircrafts with 34% biofuel in the tank emit 30% fewer ultrafine particles. We continue to develop and test technologies in ALIGHT  which concludes in 2025. Keep an eye on this page  where we regularly share results and knowledge that pave the way for the future airport.

Over the past few years we: Started investing in our own renewable power assets	 particularly through joint ventures in large-scale offshore wind farms such as the Hollandse Kust Zuid and Nordlicht projects with Vattenfall. These initiatives provide clean energy to our sites and play a key role in reducing our carbon footprint. ƒë≈∫‚Äô¬®					
√¢≈õ‚Ä¶ Concluded long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): We purchase green energy from partners	 exemplified by our long-term PPA with ENGIE for onshore wind power from Spain. This ensures a diversified and reliable renewable energy supply chain. ƒë≈∫¬§≈•														
These achievements demonstrate that we are not just talking about a more renewable future - we are actively shaping it. 								
Our aim is clear: We want to contribute to Germany's climate goals and reach our target of becoming #NetZero! ƒë≈∫≈Ω≈ª

But where has been the elephant ƒë≈∫¬ê¬ò in the room?						
						
There is one thing we can be sure of ƒë≈∫‚Äò‚Ä∞ biomass is by far today and globally the biggest source for renewable energy (power and heat combined). And not limited to this	 biomass is the only sustainable resource for green C (carbon) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) and is indispensable for industries on their way to net zero.					
						
This has been greatly explained by Andrea Ramirez. She drafted in her speech the complexity concerning the petrochemical industry in the port of Rotterdam becoming more sustainable. Without green C or CO2 from biomass waste	 hardly achievable.					
						
Valuable biochar produced by SYNCRAFT #reversepowerplants can permanently store CO2 in the form of green carbon and creating negative CO2-emissions. Apart from being used as feed additive or soil substrate	 it also has huge potential for the industry: it can be incorporated as technical carbon into concrete	 e.g. CarStorCon√Ç¬Æ Technologies GmbH				
						
By incorporating CO2 into products	 greenhouse gas emissions are reduced twice. Firstly	 as a building block and permanent sink. And secondly	 the use of fossil raw materials is reduced by saving the emissions associated with extraction and processing ƒë≈∫‚Äô≈û

A recent announcement was made at the most recent COP28 √¢‚Ç¨¬òglobal stock take√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢	 which stated that more and faster action needs to occur in order to combat the climate emergency. This necessity is why BECCS and other large-scale carbon removal projects	 are usually viewed as important and critical to the drive focused on combatting the climate emergency. This view is taken due to the aims these projects have	 with the most recent one from Drax	 stating that it will aim to have the ability to remove a minimum of 6Mt of Co2 from the atmosphere every year.	
					
The article below highlights the immediate response which Drax provided to the carbon industry	 once the news from the COP28 meeting was released. It is the large carbon capture projects which have the largest impact on the climate emergency and the article below addresses this topic.

√¢≈õ‚Äù What is your focus for the fall?							
The goal is to reach an investment decision for the full-scale BECCS plant by the end of 2024	 therefore the focus for the fall is to secure future revenues in off-take contracts for carbon removals.						
							
√¢≈õ‚Äù Who is interested in buying carbon removals?							
All companies who still have fossil carbon emissions √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú which unfortunately is almost everyone! 							
							
√¢≈õ‚Äù And why should they buy from Stockholm Exergi?							
BECCS is the most cost-efficient technology to generate permanent carbon removals at scale. And among many things	 Beccs Stockholm will show unprecedented energy and resource efficiency.

With nearly 30 years of experience in developing and refining our fuel cell technology	 we have pioneered advancements that are driving the future of clean energy. After more than 100	000 hours of validation and testing experience	 ensuring the highest reliability and performance. Close to 300 MW of power has been delivered to our customers	 making us a market leader in Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology.
				
Our products have a uniquely high power density	 delivering exceptional output while also remaining compact and lightweight	 making them suitable for diverse applications ranging from small-scale units to megawatt power installations.		
				
Our systems provide a quick pathway to decarbonisation	 featuring a stack integrated with complementary components optimised for specific applications.			
				
Our stacks empower innovative companies to leverage our extensive expertise in fuel cells	 accelerating their journey toward crafting their own solutions.			
				
We facilitate this process by offering an industry-leading 'heart' for their systems	 enabling integration with our state-of-the-art technology. ZeroAvia is a fantastic example	 spearheading emission-free aviation by incorporating our stacks into their cutting-edge hydrogen-electric technology.		
				
In collaborations with industry pioneers and partnerships with fellow innovators	 we continuously push the boundaries for our technology. Through the development of the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s most powerful marine fuel cells in the H2MARINE project and meeting extremely demanding aviation requirements in PROJECT NEWBORN	 we have established remarkable collaborations that make it possible for us to advance our next-generation fuel cell stacks.		
				
We are dedicated to continuing to provide our products to progressive companies in their transition to green energy	 whether operating on land	 at sea	 or in the air.
