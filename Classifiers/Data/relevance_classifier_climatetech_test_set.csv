"Happy Random Acts of Kindness Day! 🌞♥️While at Harrisburg Days over the summer, Community Relations Specialist Angie Christiansen found herself alone at  NorthWestern Energy ’s booth after her teammate had to leave unexpectedly due a family emergency.Local 14-year-old Conner W. stopped by the booth with his two younger brothers. Instead of herding his brothers on to the next booth, Conner stayed at the booth and did the remarkable.Within minutes of his initial stop, Conner quickly picked up on the information being shared and began fearlessly interacting with and engaging booth attendees with genuine interest and knowledge.For nearly two hours, Conner shared how to identify the different utility flags by color, locating what is underground for a digging project and alerted younger attendees that if you smell gas to tell someone right away.Without being told, Conner jumped in to help, stayed when he didn’t have to and showed the heart of the Harrisburg community.On behalf of NorthWestern Energy, a special thanks to Conner for showing up, helping out and representing your community! #RandomActsOfKindness #Kindness #HarrisburgSD #SouthDakota #NorthWesternEnergyhttp://ow.ly/iQ9y30sb1hc",0

"Excess heat is at our disposal to mitigate the complex challenges of the energy and climate crisis. Yet, few realize it's enormous potential.On a mission to unlock the world's largest untapped energy source - excess heat, we took our application know-how and insights on a tour around Europe. This week, we gathered experts, decision-makers, and policymakers at the Danish Embassy in Brussels Trade Council of Denmark in Brussels (inc. The Danish Embassy and the Danish Perm Rep to the EU).“Utilizing excess heat from industry and electricity production is integral in addressing the urgent challenges of the energy crisis and the climate crisis. There is approx. 2,860 TWh/year of waste heat accessible in Europe today, much of which can be reused through smart energy systems,” saidBrian Vad Mathiesen, Professor at Aalborg University and panelist of the event.2,860 TWh/year almost corresponds to the EU’s total energy demand for heat and hot water in residential and service sector buildings.Thank you to the panelists MEPNiels Fuglsang,Aurélie Beauvais,Drew Turner,Andreas Graf, Prof.Brian Vad Mathiesen, MPKris Verduyckt!Download our whitepaper:https://lnkd.in/e99iFu_S #EnergyEfficiency #WhyEE #EnergyCrisis #ExcessHeat",0

For example, German CEOs like to surround themselves with mirror images of themselves according to Christian Berg. That leads to a situation where 5 per cent of German CEOs are called Thomas. However, diversity means the opposite for Robert Franken. He says “the definition of diversity is: people who are different than us"" and that it “is about fixing the systems instead of fixing women"" to make a change.Thanks to the great hostsGiordana DoppstadtandSusanne Langefor this very inspiring and thought-provoking event in these challenging times.

It enables the driver  to work more efficiently, quickly and ergonomically. As Frank Bergmann, Product Manager for Counterbalanced Trucks at  Linde Material Handling , explains: “At first, the new solution will be optionally available for all counterbalanced models from four metric tons’ capacity.”Particularly in environments where there are space constraints or when trucks need to manoeuvre, this is a major improvement: “The operator can see absolutely everything around the truck. And that is of significant importance for health and safety in facilities where there is little space or where there are frequent encounters between people and trucks.”And it helps take us closer to realising our goal of “Vision Zero. Safety in your world” – in other words, the aim of completely eliminating accidents in intralogistics workplaces in the medium term.Learn more:",0

"Upcoming Webinar: Bifacial modules have an increasing application in large scale PV projects, while tracking system becomes the mainstream solution for utility-scale PV projects in Australia, with the development of 1P and 2P solutions. But there is no one single project that allows us to directly compare those combinations, not to mention the accurate comparison of the energy yield and economic evaluation. Arctech  Solar and LonGi made necessary attempts to solve this pain-point by building a unique tracker and advanced PV module demonstration project outside Melbourne. It will showcase mono and bifacial modules on 1P and 2P trackers all in one place. The four different combinations with identical electrical configurations will collect data over time from Australian local conditions. The project will also demonstrate, train, and test.Free to attend #ArctechWebinaron “Maximising Solar Return with Advanced Modules and Trackers” on Tuesday, 9 June from 12.00 – 1.00 PM (AEST).Register now:https://lnkd.in/gGE_uMFLet’s learn more about this #DemoProject.",1

I’ve spent many years as a professional bike mechanic, and continue to participate in endurance events in my region.💭 “The best thing in my work is being able to deliver meaningful application knowledge and product solutions to our customers and the industries that affect our lives. Helping industries improve processes and reduce energy consumption with some of the best measurement solutions on the market is very motivating for me.Throughout my career I have been the provider and end-user of a wide variety of measurement technology. It is extremely valuable to be able to believe in the quality of the products and services that your company provides.  Vaisala  products are able to deliver that sense of trust that make me proud to be a member of the team – actually I had my 7-year anniversary in September.During my years at Vaisala, the most memorable moment is definitely when I delivered a full-day seminar on humidity theory and measurement technology to a full conference room of our customers. It really pushed me to develop as a public speaker and subject matter expert.Regarding my personal life, building a life and a home with my wife has been my main motivation for the past several years. That and the outdoor activities I enjoy with her and my friends that take me to places that not everyone is fortunate enough to see.” #vaisala #teamvaisala",0

"It’s #internationalwomensdaytoday, and this year I’ve been reflecting on my own development and career progression. Last year, I completed a development programme with Good Energy called the Good Career Programme. It’s designed for people, like me, who are getting established in their careers and wanting to progress, to give them the tools, skills and confidence to do so.We covered lots of different topics, such as leadership and business strategy, and spoke to senior people all over the business. It helped me to really hone in on the specific areas I wanted to develop and work out a plan for doing so.Then when a promotion opportunity came available, I had the confidence to go for it. Now, I lead the Marketing Campaigns team atGood Energywith four talented marketers reporting to me. It’s a really busy exciting time as we are launching solar panel and heat pump installation services as well as supplying 100% renewable electricity. I never expected to be where I am at this point in my career.I feel very fortunate to have a manager that supports me with my development, so it’s something I absolutely prioritise with my own team now. I think a lot of young people, and women in particular, can really struggle with the confidence needed to progress in their careers. I know I did. We’re led to believe that we need experience in management already to apply for a management position, which maybe keeps us at a lower grade for longer.My advice to other young women is to write down what you want to achieve, create a plan, and let people know about your aspirations so you get the right support.  Age shouldn’t be a barrier to progressing – if you’ve got the drive and the skills then it will get noticed. #internationalwomensday #careers #femaletalent",1
