" Danfoss  at  COP27: without urgent action to curb energy demand, the build out of renewables will be insufficient to meet the needs of a growing population and the electrification of our societies. COP27 is coming to an end this week as climate envoys enter the final phase of negotiations.Rasmus Abildgaard Kristensen, Vice President for Group Public Affairs at Danfoss, shined a light on the overlooked potential of energy efficiency at COP27 from¬†energy transition, AI,¬†cold chain technology, sustainable cities, and zero emission construction sites.¬†Rasmus says, ‚ÄúWe need world leaders to step up, act and enshrine minimum energy efficiency requirements into law. Without urgent action, energy demand will grow significantly,¬†and we will remain off track¬†to meet global climate goals. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), a collective push for energy efficiency can deliver one-third of the total emissions reductions needed to reach net zero.‚ÄùFind out more about #EnergyEfficiencyin our new whitepaper, The Neglected Demand Side of the Green¬†Equation:https://bit.ly/3G1hCqV #WhyEE #TogetherForImplementation #GreenTransition #Building4Tomorrow #Electrification #BuildingsPavilion",1

"Charlie Grimes is a retired lawyer who became a member of BMC‚Äôs Patient Family Advisory Council (PFAC) last year. The PFAC is a diverse group of patients, families, and staff who meet every month to help improve the patient experience at BMC and achieve our mission of equitable care for all.üí≠ How did you first get to know BMC?üó£ I was referred to BMC‚Äôs Amyloidosis Center after I was diagnosed with amyloidosis in 2011.  I chose BMC because they are a top center in the world for this very rare condition. I was very sick when I first arrived at BMC, but they treated me with a regimen that put my amyloidosis into remission for six years. When my biomarkers began to turn negative in 2018, my doctors enrolled me in a clinical trial with a new drug that again put my condition into remission, and that‚Äôs where I am today. Fundamentally BMC saved my life. The overall survival rate was five years when I first presented, so the treatment worked very well.üí≠ Why did you join the PFAC?üó£ When I was confronted with what I thought was a life-ending diagnosis, the clinicians at BMC treated me with kindness, respect, sympathy, candor, and human support to get through a very challenging and uncomfortable period of my life. I feel that BMC is staffed with such remarkably kind and competent people that it must be well run at its foundation, and I wanted to support that.Although I‚Äôve received stellar care, I know all institutions can make improvements. I believe that the PFAC can act as a conduit for criticism, look at the problem, and help make sure it gets to the right person. With my background in running the administrative side of a large law firm, I thought my experience could be useful.üí≠ What do you hope the PFAC can accomplish?üó£ I think the PFAC can enhance the patient and family experience and improve the perception of BMC by patients, families, and the community at large. As an independent forum, we can hear problems and put a human face on them.So far, I‚Äôve been impressed by the leadership of the PFAC, especially Sophie Wilson.

""[But] there is no investment because there is so much uncertainty about the transition."" Marco commented. This is why in 2020 and despite the uncertainty,  Mercuria  committed that as a company we would direct 50% of all investments into the energy transition within 5 years.Meanwhile, our President, Daniel Jaeggi, was in Houston, at the Argus Americas Crude Summit.

"A world free from fossil fuels ‚Äì this is our vision at Sunfire¬†üåç But we cannot do it alone. That's why we're supporting initiatives that share our ambitions. ""DresdenZero"" is one of them ‚Äì aiming for carbon neutrality of our beautiful hometown Dresden until 2035. The team has collected more than 24,500 signatures for its citizen's petition that the municipal administration has now endorsed, proposing to lay down carbon net neutrality until 2035 as a goal in the revision of the integrated energy and climate protection concept (IEK).We're convinced: Carbon neutrality will not hurt Dresden's economy, but rather unlock economic potentials, attract talent and other sustainable businesses and increase the quality of life in Dresden even further. Thus, we fully support DresdenZero and urge the city council to vote in favor of the climate in December!¬†üôå",1

Key takeaways:üí° In his keynote speech,Igor Korkhovyi, Deputy Minister for Communities and Territorial Development of Ukraine highlighted that immediate, short-term actions to respond to the emergency humanitarian crisis are naturally at the forefront.

"Denmark‚Äôs first fully electric Scania 25L with combined crane and compactor construction for waste collection is now in use on the streets of Copenhagen, operated by global waste management company Urbaser. All the main components of the crane truck ‚Äì chassis, crane and waste compactor ‚Äì are electrically powered, and the crane can easily run for a full day on a single charge.When the containers need to be emptied, the driver uses the electrically powered crane to lift the containers out of the concrete shaft in which they stand. The container is then swung over the truck‚Äôs electrically-driven waste compactor, after which the bottom of the container is opened so that the waste falls into the compactor, where it is compressed.The first three months of operation with the all-electric Scania crane truck have shown that its total of nine battery packs with a gross capacity of 297 kWh have ample capacity for more than a full day's driving. In fact, there is usually 40%. battery capacity left by the end of the day, even though the batteries supply power for both the truck‚Äôs driving and for the hydraulic system on the compactor unit. The crane is a 24.5 t/m Fassi that runs on its own battery pack with electric power take-off and 86 kWh battery capacity, which is also enough for a full day‚Äôs operation.Before the electric crane truck was put into operation, Scania Denmark, in collaboration with Urbaser, had carried out a simulation of the range of the routes for which the truck will be used. With electric trucks, it is important to adapt the operation to the daily driving distance, the operation of the crane and compactor, the geographic location of the charging infrastructure and the capacity in relation to the truck‚Äôs battery systems. #electrification",1

But to achieve a real transition for a better world, we must address all three parameters of sustainability, security, and equity of the energy ecosystem.

We recognize and deeply appreciate their connection to this place.These traditional territories were never wholly surrendered and were only claimed by competing French and British Crowns, and later New York State.As we move towards healing past injustices, we must acknowledge the wrongs that have been done and work towards a unified path of co-existence and prosperity. We also recognize the contributions of the Akwesasne Mohawk, Haudenosaunee, and other Indigenous peoples have made, both in shaping and strengthening this community in particular, and other territories within the country as a whole.""",0

We are shaping the mobility of the future to be safer and more sustainable. That is why we have developed a clear decarbonization strategy to make our entire value chain climate neutral. This includes, for example, measures to use renewable energies and CO2-reduced starting materials, as well as driving forward a circular economy. 

We are working closely with our customers, suppliers, and partners to implement these measures. After all, decarbonization of the entire value chain can only succeed if we work together. 

In addition to reducing our CO2 emissions, the sensitive use of water resources or the preservation of biodiversity, for example, are among the environmental issues we are working on. More information is available here: https://t1p.de/k0emj

"Within our munitions response capability, Weston and our partners from the University of Delaware and Geometrics, Inc. have madeinnovative technological advancements in the detection of military munitions in underwater environments. Through a DoD Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) funded project, we have successfully integrated an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a total field magnetometer: the AUV Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) Detection System that performs underwater surveys without human interaction. Pre-planned missions are uploaded to the AUV control center to de¬≠fine data collection metrics: speed, height above sea‚Äëfloor or depth, and lane or transect spacing specially designed to meet data quality objectives for wide area assessment (WAA) or full-coverage digital geophysical mapping surveys. As a result of the AUV‚Äôs modular design, autonomous navigation, and rapid deployment capabilities, the System provides cost savings over current surface vessel surveys by reducing the mobilization/demobilization effort, requiring less manpower for operation and reducing/eliminating the need for a surface support vessel.

The 12 tonne 800kW single-stage two-speed helical gearbox is primarily used in a Hot Strip Mill application at the customer‚Äôs steel plant. The scope of work involved the replacement of gears, pinions and bearings, as the customer required some modification work on the output shaft, which was both manufactured and supplied by us.Our team accomplished the modification work on the Output Shaft, which had a diameter of 400mm, was 2.6 metres long and weighed an impressive 1.5 tonnes.

In these cases, no or inadequate BOM supervision was conducted.This major issue definitely comes from the use of low-quality glass, poorly thermally treated (if treated).Only by taking a quick look at the info related to glass properties in #datasheets(see examples below), one can see how scarce or unclear the details come across.In any case, in our experience, no matter how glass is described (tempered, heat-strenghtened, annealed, semi-tempered, thermally pre-stressed,...), in-factory deep verification is mandatory, even via testing.Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate this and many other risks when selecting and purchasing PV modules.How?

"Inspired by so many posts I have seen today on #internationwomensday. I decided to write one myself. Today shouldn't be tokenistic, #IWDshould be everyday and we all have a part to play to ensure that women and other under represented people in the workplace or in senior level roles have the support, flexibility and opportunities to thrive, don't hold themselves back or aren't held back.Last year I turned 40, this picture was taken a few days before my big birthday. Reflecting back, I realise that it was a turning point for me both personally and professionally.I have always had inner resilience and the ability to bounce back from anything, but there have been so many times in my career where I have doubted myself, played small and got in my own way.I started at Good Energy in November 2019 and in many ways it has been the steepest learning curve and the most rewarding one in my career to date. The culture, my colleagues across the business and the fantastic support, trust and stretch I have had from my managerFrancoise Woodwardhas allowed me the freedom and opportunity to grow a Talent & Development function and last year to be successful in becoming a Head of.Through the years at Good Energy I transitioned to working a 9 day fortnight, had access to coaching withSarah Morganand have been supported to do an Executive Coaching & Mentoring qualification to name a few things. All of which have supported my development in different ways.I don't get everything right, I don't have all the answers and I definitely still have lots to learn (about our industry)! However I don't worry about this, as much, anymore or let these things hold me back. I feel confident in what I do bring to the table, to my team, to my colleagues and to the wider business. And that is me - my own unique talent, style and commitment to support others to have opportunities to grow, develop and to champion them.My top tips to others are: seek out a variety of opportunities, don't worry if you don't know where you want to end up - some people are clear and can establish a career ladder and others will have more of a squiggly career, attitude and work ethic are so important, get yourself a mentor or someone to support and challenge you and lastly you can be a leader, even if you don't have the title...yet. #internationalwomensday2023 #iwd2023 #selfbelief #development #growth #femaletalent #learning",0

"juwi employees help in the disaster area: Since last week, up to 15 juwi employees have been on duty in the community of Altenburg in the Ahr valley in Germany, which was severely affected by the flood disaster. In cooperation with the grid operator Westnetz, the colleagues of juwi Operations & Maintenance ensure that all households in Altenburg are supplied with electricity again. For the first 17 families, the power supply could already be restored over the weekend; in another 72 houses, the emergency power supply has been installed and now still has to be switched on.The relief action was organized spontaneously last week: After some colleagues had already been involved in the clean-up work in the region in the first days after the floods through their commitment in rescue services and relief organizations and as volunteers, the idea arose to also help with the electrical engineering know-how available at juwi. Over the course of the past week, this developed into a large-scale operation in which the juwi team very quickly took over the coordination of the electrotechnical work, on which 52 electricians from juwi as well as from companies in the region and volunteer groups were deployed at peak times. The feat was worth it. Together, they succeeded in reconnecting all houses that were still habitable to the power supply.For this, all those involved deserve a huge thank you. The pictures and reports that our colleagues have brought back from their disaster mission make the extent of the destruction even more tangible for all of us. We would like to express our sympathy to all those who have been personally affected, directly or indirectly, by the extreme weather conditions and thank the countless helpers. In addition to providing active support on the ground, we are also contributing financially through various aid organizations to help combat the consequences of the floods. We very much hope that this strong sense of community, which can be felt in the clean-up and reconstruction work, will give hope to the affected people on the ground. #infrastructure #disasterrelief #electricity #germany #flooddisaster",0

Once one WDS element map is complete, AZtecWave will automatically set up the Wave Spectrometer for the next map and proceed to acquire it. If you want to perform EDS mapping at the same time, this will acquire for the entire length of time of the WDS acquisition. For example, if you map two elements with WDS and both take 30 seconds, the EDS maps will be collected for 60 seconds.üëâhttps://okt.to/sYHtDj #WDSpectrometry #WDSMapping #WavelengthDispersiveSpectrometry",0

"In this blog post the International Currency Association examines how scientific articles aren't always reported in a balanced way and how headlines can be misleading. The blog follows on from recent headlines that claim the coronavirus survives a long time on banknotes (neglecting to also mention that this relates to coronavirus at high concentrations, certain temperatures and in the dark).What's particularly interesting is that the media articles that led to this blog were all based on a scientific report that mentions the coronavirus is thought to be mainly spread via respiratory droplets. Respiratory droplets weren't the headline. The scientific report measured the survival time of the coronavirus on multiple surfaces. Other surfaces didn't make the headline. The reasons for focussing on banknotes only is not clear from the scientific conclusions of the source study.The blog highlights the importance of reading beyond the headlines (ideally reading to the referenced sources) in order for a reader to form an accurate understanding of what is being reported. Banknotes continue to benefit many people, including some who don't even realise it.https://hubs.li/H0xQknj0",0

The cost of the radioactive isotopes used in research also is a major barrier, with some costing more than $10,000 per microgram. Certain radioisotopes also cannot be produced in sufficient quantity so it is simply impossible for researchers to study them with current laboratory techniques.A new approach developed at #LLNLallows for the study of radioactive and/or precious elements in a much more efficient way, requiring 1,000 times less materials than previous state-of-the-art methods, without compromising the data quality.

"[News from the #STBlog:https://bddy.me/3tJxIOd]ST is launching a new series of sensors that offer a greater performance-per-watt ratio, starting with the LSM6DSV16X, the latest member of our family of inertial MEMS with a machine learning core. Following the LSM6DSOX and LSM6DSRX, the LSM6DSV16X is more accurate than the former and uses less energy than the latter. Moreover, it‚Äôs the first time such a device has offered Qvar sensing to measure quasi-electrostatic potentials. We are also announcing the industry‚Äôs first dual full-scale pressure sensors. The LPS22DF and the LPS28DFW feature a low consumption of only 1.7 ¬µA and an absolute accuracy of 0.5 hPa. Finally, the LIS2DU12 is a three-axis accelerometer consuming only 0.45 ¬µA. Let us thus examine how ST managed to offer a machine learning core with an ODR of 240 Hz while keeping the power consumption at a minimum of 0.65 mA. The new LSM6DSV16X can also measure quasi-electrostatic potential, which opens the way to a whole new type of motion detection. #mems #sensors",0

"Many of our best-loved food and drink brands are synonymous with the traditions, quirks, and personalities of their countries of origin. Representing your nation carries with it a heavy weight of social responsibility. Brands need to be seen to be ""doing the right thing""; especially when it comes to reducing their carbon footprint. By adopting a leadership role in the battle against climate change, energy-intensive manufacturing and brewing processes can be transformed into platforms for innovation; challenging us to improve how we generate, distribute, and consume energy when producing our favourite products.

"And now the #SpaceWeatherreport!We are excited to have recently commissioned the first permanent geoelectric monitoring station in the country, at the Canberra magnetic observatory. Geoelectric monitoring is an important technique in modelling and understanding space weather impacts, which cause geomagnetically induced currents that can damage vital infrastructure such as electric transmission grids and pipelines.The new equipment captured the induced geoelectric field for the first K-index 6 geomagnetic storm that started on 23 March, the same storm that caused beautiful auroras across southern Australia.Our team was excited to find that the induced fields are enhanced in the west to east direction. This is consistent with our geomagnetically induced current hazard model for NSW/VIC, where power transmission lines that are roughly perpendicular to the shoreline (W-E) have a relatively higher induced line voltage than those that are roughly parallel to the shoreline (S-N).These are just the first findings from our new monitoring station. We are looking forward to the quality space weather data that the new station will give us, and to the opportunities we‚Äôll gain in modelling and understanding the impacts of space weather.Learn more üëâhttps://bit.ly/40QVEOn.",0

"Hard. Soft. Crash-resistant.70 years ago, the invention of the crumple zone revolutionised vehicle body design. But how does a crumple zone actually work?For maximum safety, the vehicle is divided into several zones of different strengths. The passenger compartment has the highest strength, while the front and rear zones are lower in strength and therefore act as crumple zones. This allows them to deform and absorb energy, thereby reducing the amount of force applied to the occupants in an accident.And that's exactly where BENTELER comes in ‚Äì we supply products with zones of differing strength according to their respective crash management needs. Either in modular form or as complete, fully integrated crash management solutions.

"This is a very interesting report from the USA about the ‚Äòcoal cost crossover‚Äô ‚Äì which shows that 209 out of 210 US coal plants are now more expensive to run than new clean energy.

‚ÄúWe find 99 percent of plants are more expensive to run than replacing their generation capacity with either new solar or new wind. The savings of using renewables would be significant: The cost of either new wind or solar is at least 30 percent cheaper than the cost of running more than three-quarters of existing U.S. coal plants.‚Äù

The report also suggests that replacing over 200 of the coal plants with local clean energy could generate almost $600 billion in new investment.

America‚Äôs energy transition is certainly gathering pace.

"These days, it's totally normal to talk to gadgets in your life. Tech is smart and ultra-connected. Though the era of smart devices, otherwise known as the Internet of Things (IoT), all began with far humbler origins: a vending machine in the Carnegie Mellon University  School of Computer Science.In the early 1980s, David Nichols, a computer science graduate student now working at Microsoft , enjoyed having a Coca Cola from the vending machine in the department. But because the machine was four minutes from his office and would occasionally be out of stock, Nichols wanted a way to check whether the walk would be worth it or end in disappointment.Along with some other students, Nichols was able to wire things up so that you could find out whether there were cokes in the various columns of the coke machine. The wires attached to the in-stock light indicators in each button and through some coding and work with network packets, eventually anyone could sit at any computer in the computer science department and find out the status of the machine ‚Äî whether the drinks were stocked, and if they were cold or not.As Nichols said, ""we didn't think we were doing anything that amazing. it was just like, 'great, now I can find out whether I have a coke.'""Internet-connected appliances have come a long way since then. CNN 's Anna Stewart recently investigated how the Internet of Things began and is still changing the way we live on her show ""Decoded.""https://cmu.is/iot- cnn ",0

"Earlier this year, on a routine survey of our Providence #SolarFarm, Silicon Ranch Regional Manager of Power Plant Maintenance,Davin Smithand his team noticed that some of the clips holding source circuit bundles and module leads had failed.How? As Davin put it, ‚Äúchanges in weather have a way of exposing or bringing about issues that weren‚Äôt necessarily a problem before.‚Äù In this case freezing rain had attached to the bundle adding extra weight,¬†while also freezing certain module leads, causing gravity to not work in our wire management‚Äôs favor during the tracker‚Äôs movement. To compound on the issue the plastic clips and the metal racking system on which they were attached do not contract and expand at the same rate. Eventually the clips on this particular rack gave-way to the weight and began to sag, while the individual leads began to snag during tracker operation among other compounding technical issues.Not only does that not look good, but it will ‚Äúlead to ground fault potential, and we have to be cognizant of the livestock that we have on our sites as part of our #RegenerativeEnergyplatform,‚Äù notes Davin.The solution, Davin presents toNick de Vriesan alternative to the plastic clips‚Äîa PVC covered aluminum zip-tie‚Äîwhich he refers to as the ‚ÄúNew Kid in Town.‚ÄùOur long-term ownership approach puts our team members in a position to bring solutions to potential problems before they get out of hand, while also emphasizing remediations that will last the life of the plant. That same ownership model enables immediate insight and learning opportunities to refine the design of our future projects.

¬†
The world‚Äôs oceans are vital to the Earth System ‚Äì but like all of its elements they are suffering from damaging impacts of human activity.¬†
¬†
Climate change is causing ocean heatwaves, ocean acidification is wreaking havoc on its ecosystems, and plastic pollution has wound up in the air, the rain and even in breast milk. But most of it remains in the seas, harming untold numbers of sea creatures every day.¬†
¬†
That‚Äôs why Mainstream employees in Dublin and Cape Town organised beach clean-ups, while our colleagues in Vietnam planted Casuarina saplings¬†trees near Ho Chi Minh, to help safeguard coastal ecosystems, also marking World Environment Day. ¬†

And our Sustainability Team is encouraging employees all over the globe¬†to live our key Sustainability value by going plastic-free for a day, to help stop marine pollution at source.¬†

"One of our key charity partners, RedSTART the charity set up to improve financial education for children, has just launched a major study assessing the link between primary-age financial education and social mobility. Over the next seven years, the charity will work with 47 primary schools and up to 17,000 children in underprivileged areas to determine whether there is a benefit to having money lessons early in life. As part of the first phase of the project, RedSTART has commissionedKing's College LondonPolicy Institute to conduct a longitudinal study evaluating the attitude, behaviour and educational attainment of children receiving financial education from RedSTART, versus those not receiving any support.For schools receiving intervention, central to the programme will be the RedSTART Bank app, which allows children to practice buying, selling and saving in a controlled environment, as well as accessing quizzes to complement learning being delivered in-person by volunteers.Sarah Marks, CEO RedSTART says: ‚ÄúResearch shows that financial habits are learned in early life, and so improving levels of financial literacy in the UK means giving children a strong head start. Change the Game seeks to do this in two ways, chiefly by focussing resources on primary-age children in areas identified by the Government as being most in need.‚ÄúSecondly, by educating the same children over the course of their time at primary school, the programme aims to develop skills made to last, while enabling us to build up concrete evidence on the impact of early, continuous intervention education on children‚Äôs financial understanding.‚ÄúOur ultimate aim is to no longer be needed and, if we can convince the Government to recognise the critical gap in educational provision and take on board our recommendations, then we will be well on course to achieving that objective.‚ÄúWe strongly believe that a base understanding of debt, saving and investments needs to be planted in the primary generation to avoid financial illiteracy worsening around the UK. In partnership with our partners, schools and volunteers, we have every confidence that we can empower more children with this knowledge and enable them to take control of their money unhindered by the consequences of unhelpful spending patterns adopted from an early age.‚ÄùA total of 17 firms across the financial services sector - including PIC - have pledged to help RedSTART achieve the aims of Change the Game. #education #learning #financialliteracy #financialliteracyforkids #financialliteracymatters #pensions #socialvalue #gettingthingsdoneNick Lennon-BarrettMidori Abraham",0

" Vaisala  Launches Route Manager: Web-Based Automation for Winter Road Maintenance Treatment DesignVaisala today introduced Vaisala Route Manager, a web-based route optimization service that significantly reduces the time and effort involved to create treatment routes based on weather hazards, network priorities and available resources.Increased road usage, budget limitations, increasing driver expectations, and a rise in severe weather events combine to present winter road maintenance operators with challenges in keeping roads clear and safe. Route Manager helps road authorities ensure their network is treated in the most efficient way possible. The web-based route optimization service significantly reduces the time and effort involved to create and update treatment routes based on network priorities and available resources.Vaisala has a proven track record in providing route optimization services, as Stephen Smyth, Senior Manager, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, explained: ‚ÄúVaisala has developed a better way to plan winter maintenance service and treatment routes. Identifying areas for increased efficiency and precise resource requirements to facilitate this has enabled me to plan effectively going forward.‚Äùhttps://bit.ly/2Yu5tlk",0

"All week we've been celebrating National Apprenticeship Week by highlighting some of our apprentices on our Instagram account.For more information about Edwards' apprenticeships, including current vacancies, please have a look at our website:https://bit.ly/3YCkLDCMeet Niamh Daniels, Mechanical Degree Apprentice.How long have you been at Edwards?I‚Äôve been at Edwards for just over a year (since September 2021).Why did you choose to apply for an Apprenticeship?I knew an apprenticeship would be the most appropriate route for me, as I learn better practically. I was also motivated to get a degree, but after finishing college, unsure if full-time university was for me. Apprenticeships are a great mode of study if you are feeling ready for the workplace.What is the most interesting part of your Apprenticeship?I really love learning new things from a variety of people (from skilled workers to subject matter experts), all with years of experience and an eagerness to pass on their knowledge.What attracted you to Edwards?I was aware that Edwards had a friendly and supportive company culture (with enthusiasm to invest in their employees). Edwards and Atlas Copco are highly regarded in engineering, producing reputable products, so I was also keen to get involved with the interesting/varied work associated with their research and development.Any advice for people looking to apply?When you apply, obviously make sure to include any past academic results in your application, but I would say it is just as important to include work experience (especially if it relates to the field you are applying to), and practical projects you may have undergone ‚Äì maybe consider making a portfolio. People who manage/hire apprentices will be enthusiastic to see this as they ultimately want to know what you will be like in a workplace, doing the job you have applied for. #naw2023 #SkillsForLife",0

Together, we will help solve one of the most critical challenges related to unlocking a carbon free grid. Transmission capacity.Today just in the #USalone, more than 1.4 TW of renewable energy and storage projects are waiting to interconnect to the grid. However, these projects are stuck in ever growing interconnection queues, on top of the rapidly rising congestion costs. Traditional grid upgrades such as building new transmission lines or reconductoring, can help, but they end up taking years and often face an uphill battle with siting and permitting. GE Grid Solutions and LineVision have partnered to deliver an end-to-end Dynamic System Rating solution, which will increase the capacity and utilization of the existing grid by combining Dynamic Line Rating, Dynamic Power Rating, and Optimal Power Flow Control. By combining these three #GridEnhancingTechnologiesinto one platform, utilities are now able to deploy a fully integrated solution that will reduce grid congestion and integrate more renewables onto the grid.Learn more about our exciting collaboration by clicking on the link below. #ChangeTheWorld #carbonreduction #climatechange #cleanenergyfutureClaudia Cosoreanu, PEng, MBAMital Kanabar, PhD, PEngMassimo NardiAlex HoughtalingJon MarmilloHudson GilmerCarson CaseyAshvin BapatNicolas GiberguesWayne HartmannMudassir Machhiwala, P.Eng.Kamyar Moghadam P.

"At a job interview, it says here that you love Halloween.Me:Hello friends! It's your favorite nature nerds here to celebrate a historic anniversary. 2023 marks the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA provides legal protections to plants and wildlife that are threatened or endangered.Species like the bald eagle, American alligator, California condor, and hundreds more have all been brought back from the edge of extinction by the ESA. The California condor still requires protection, but others like the bald eagle, have fully recovered!The ESA aims to protect and recover imperiled species and the ecosystems they depend on. We work hand in hand with agencies like the National Park Service to conduct conservation and restoration activities and minimize negative impacts on imperiled species within NPS sites.Throughout its history, the ESA has proven to be effective in stabilizing species populations, preventing species extinction, and conserving habitats upon which they depend. We're glad to have partners like the National Park Service to help us celebrate this historic law! #ESA50 #WorldWildlifeDayPhoto of a juvenile California condor at Pinnacles National Park by Jeffrey Schwegman.",0

" #COP27represents a unique opportunity to change the course of the events and design a #sustainablesociety powered by #cleanenergy.Extreme climate events, desertification and melting glaciers, are just some of the consequences of #climatechange: in fact, climate change negatively affects human life under every aspect, making our societies more vulnerable and unsecure. Although sometimes it seems insurmountable, we have the duty to speak up and put pressure on institutions and governments at international level and make them respect Paris Agreement‚Äôs 1.5¬∞ target. #ERGis deploying all its resources to invest in clean energy production from wind and solar assets, all across Europe, giving a crucial helping hand in decarbonizing our economies. Nevertheless, we expect that COP27 will take into account some other issues, direct effects of climate change: next generation right to live in a health world full of opportunities; the need to have a fair and equal #energytransitionthat doesn‚Äôt leave anyone behind; a more inclusive society that respects any diversity.To accomplish this, we must ask the international community to unlock renewables development and accelerate the energy transition: it is not only a matter of humankind survival, but a great opportunity to realize a brand new world, making ourselves proud of our actions.We can be the giants on whose shoulders the hopes of tomorrow's world will rest. #SDGsContributors #greenenERGymakers",1

" #ArctechShareUnparalleled Advantages of SkySmart II Tracking System over other 2P TrackersA typical #2Psingle-axis tracking system has only one drive point as the fixed point, resulting in deformation and vibration of the system under high winds. The #SkySmartIItracking system of #Arctech, by contrast, adopts a parallel multi-point drive design and relies on the world first‚Äôs triple mechanism that works as three fixed points, improving the wind resistance capability and the wind stow threshold significantly.Meanwhile, many 2P trackers adopt cheaper linear actuators as the main drive. However,  Arctech  SkySmart II tracking system replaces them with independent slew drives for fewer components and increased #reliability.On the other hand, the solar project sites often featured uneven or undulating terrain, when adopting linear actuators, it needs to set the tilt angle before installing the foundation posts. But the SkySmart II can place the slew drive seats on the top for free angle adjustment, it is more flexible for sure. #solar #renewableenergy #trackers #PV #renewables",1

Once you dig deeper, however, not all kilowatt hours are created equally. When it comes to the production of electricity, the conversion of primary energy into electricity. The process affects the grid on which the electricity is delivered. Consider personal transport as an analogy, where a seat is the equivalent to a kilowatt hour and the road is the electrical grid. Any seat will provide the same transport function, but the effect on the road will be different. Be it a bus, car or motorbike providing the seat.

As a result of two years of planning and many hours of work, the facility is now more reliable and efficient, providing up to 330 MW into Alberta‚Äôs electrical grid.A key factor in realizing these improvements was the replacement of CEC‚Äôs combustion turbine rotor. Replacing the rotor was no easy feat and required a ‚Äúunified lift,‚Äù where the old rotor and single piece exhaust was removed from its casing and replaced with a new and improved rotor.This was the heaviest lift in ENMAX Energy history weighing in at an astounding 86,000 kg! To put this into perspective, this is equivalent in weight to almost six of our new electric medium duty fleet vehicles. Or if rockets are more your thing, this is similar in weight to an unfueled SpaceX Starship rocket.This time lapse video recaps the unified lift event.

"In an interview with Swiss newspaper Le Temps, Gerard Delsad, Managing Director of  Vitol  SA talked about Vitol‚Äôs investments in renewables, the impact of the energy transition on the business and why the company is still investing in fossil fuel production.The full interview is attached in French, with some highlights in English below:Vitol‚Äôs commitment to sustainable energy projectsSince 2018 Vitol has committed $1.5 billion to sustainable projects. We want to be a major player in the energy transition and we hope that governments will put policies in place to accelerate it.Which technologies we are invested in and which we expect to do wellThis will vary by region. The most established technologies are solar and wind. We are also investing in waste-to-gas, carbon capture systems or green hydrogen, made from electricity supplied by a dam in Norway. We have also built an infrastructure for 200 electric city buses in Bogota, Colombia. At this point it is hard to foresee which technologies will dominate where.Why we are still investing in fossil fuelsThe world needs reliable energy at a reasonable price. There has been a lot of underinvestment in fossil fuels in recent years, which is one of the reasons for the current market tightness.On managing our carbon emissionsWe have done a lot of work to measure our carbon footprint and we have set intermediate targets to decarbonise elements of our business. For example, we want to achieve a 40% reduction in carbon intensity for our own fleet of ships by 2024, well before 2030, which is the date set by the International Maritime Organisation.Our outlook for global oil demandWe believe overall oil demand will peak between 2030 and 2035, but that road transport oil demand will peak in 2025-2030. We estimate that demand in Asia and other developing countries will increase, due to rising living standards and population growth.How our business model needs to evolve as we move away from oil and into other productsThe expertise we need is changing but the core business will remain the same. We will continue to supply energy, optimise flows and analyse supply and demand to balance markets. #energytransition #peakoil #renewableenergy",1

"Marine Geoscience is important for mapping and characterising the seabed to support the sustainable management of Australia‚Äôs marine environment. One of our scientists, Dr Mardi McNeil, recently travelled to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to conduct a marine survey of this fascinating part of the country.The survey, on the CSIRO ‚Äôs Marine National Facility Research Vessel Investigator, involved seabed mapping and sampling, extracting cores, and taking many oceanographic and atmospheric measurements. This particular work focussed on a particular type of calcified green algae known as Halimeda.The internal skeletons of Halimeda are shed and build up over thousands to tens of thousands of years, forming vast geological structures on the seafloor called bioherms. Not only do these Halimeda bioherms look like green doughnutsüç©, but they play an invaluable role in capturing and storing carbon, making it extremely important to understand where they are located and what their relationship is to the undersea landscape.The survey studied a range of Halimeda habitats including channels, passages, slopes, submarine canyons and basins, as well as the oceanographic processes that occur around them.Learn more about #Marine #Geosciencein action: a search for green doughnuts üëâhttps://bit.ly/3UJtcLWüì∑The vibrocoring system being deployed from RV Investigator.

"Business conditions and the regulatory environment have a major impact on business. A recent blog post on the Top 10 Operational Risks of 2022 tapped subject matter experts at  Sphera  to make sense of the risk landscape and determine what it means for ORM professionals. Three of those experts, Sphera Solution Consultants Andy Bartlett and Abhilash Menon and Solution Executive Tim Floyd, joined the SpheraNow podcast to discuss why those risks were selected for the list and provide additional insights.When discussing why cybersecurity made the list, Abhilash Menon explains ‚ÄúWe have heard multiple prominent individuals tell us that data is the new oil. And on a daily basis, organizations generate data, the majority of which is sensitive, operational data. Everything that we communicate today is on the cloud and organizations such as Microsoft, Amazon, and the others are investing massively in this space. They're also investing in the security aspect of it. But those who are determined will find their way around it. There is someone out there who is smart enough and will find better ways to break through.¬†And once you are compromised, apart from the challenge of getting back to normal operations, which is estimated to be around 300 days, there is a bigger fallout from the loss of public trust in your reputation for safeguarding data. This is over and above millions you might pay as ransom to get back to your own data.

This will undoubtedly prove even more true in the months leading up to the new Department of Energy (DOE) standard governing pool pumps.

"Microvast's innovative battery cell technology powers high performance electric race car. ‚ö°

""...Porsche has shown us what might be the first racing application of the technology developed as part of the project, the 718 Cayman GT4 ePerformance.
(...)
Carried over from the Mission R project is the use of the same high-voltage (900 V) technology. The front and rear batteries are used in parallel, with each being rated at 908 V. Each battery has 216 pouch cells connected in series; from that we can infer that Porsche rates the cells at a little in excess of 4.2 V, which is a common voltage for lithium-ion cells when fully charged. The cells are NMC 622 types from Microvast.""

"The Endangered Species Act (ESA) turns 50 years old this year, and it's more important than ever.  

Currently, the ESA protects 1,662 U.S. species and 638 foreign species. With ongoing threats such as habitat loss and new threats like climate change, a commitment to species conservation, the ESA continues to be vital. Ninety-nine percent of the species that have received protections under the ESA have avoided extinction.   

To commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Endangered Species Act, we released a poster featuring portraits of eight federally listed species that have been put on the road to recovery due to this important law. These eight species have been the focus of intense recovery efforts working with countless agencies, organizations and dedicated community members.  

Today, many people don‚Äôt have easy access to nature, and most of us will never see an endangered species. This art aims to help people connect with endangered species by bringing them into people‚Äôs homes, onto their screens and into their hearts.  

Tune into our channels every day this week to celebrate Endangered Species Week with us!  #ESA50

To confirm, SRC is not connected in any way with that third-party company.SRC‚Äôs Rare Earth Processing Facility will produce high value rare earth elements (REEs) and magnet metals using REE minerals and will operate in the mid-stream supply chain. SRC is not a mining company, nor does it have commercial interests in mining operations.

As a result, the service could enable the average EV driver to save over $550 a year and reduce their charging carbon emissions by 36%.The launch of the service follows a recent grid emergency in California whereby EV drivers were asked to avoid charging at specific times. Helping to prevent such measures in the future, EBCE and Kaluza‚Äôs program will prove how EV smart charging will relieve system pressure by automatically shifting charging away from peak times. By 2030, technology such as this could save the United States over $15 billion a year without sacrificing the convenience, comfort and wallets of drivers who decide to go green.Read the full press release here:https://lnkd.in/gbxme852 #VGI #electricvehicles #emobility #California",1

"Hydro dams have been known for their role in generating electricity, but do you know they also mitigate flooding by holding huge amounts of water that could have naturally flown downstream?Here are responses to some FAQs on KenGen Kenya 's hydro plants.QN 1: Why are the Seven Forks Dams famous in Kenya?ANS: They are among the first and the biggest hydro dams in Kenya. For many years, they were the main source of electric power for the country.QN 2: Why the name Seven Forks?ANS: Between Gitaru dam and Kindaruma dam the river splits into seven tributaries, hence the name Seven Forks.QN 3: Does KenGen open up the dams when they are full to release excess water?ANS: No, dams naturally overflow when they fill up. The overflows happen only during extremely heavy rains in the Tana River Catchment area.QN 4: Are hydro-power dams responsible for flooding experienced by communities living downstream?ANS: No. The dams lessen flooding downstream by holding huge volumes of water that could naturally have flown downstream.QN 5: Is the Aberdares the only catchment area for River Tana?ANS: No. There is a big catchment area that feeds rivers joining River Tana after Kiambere including Rivers Thura-Ena, Mutonga and Kathita. #KenGenHydroEnergy #EnergyChampion^EM[Pictured:KenGen Kenya's Turkwel Dam in West Pokot County]",0

"Comprehensive estate planning often goes much further than simply having a will. For instance, one can provide for transfers of assets to a living trust (also known as a revocable trust) to supplement the will. For many, the best part of this strategy is that the trust assets don‚Äôt have to pass through probate. An additional step can be taken by creating a pour-over will.

"Creating safer homes and buildings, that's our goal. A big part of that is fire safety.Not all insulation materials react the same way to fire and heat. A material's combustibility is determined by a series of ‚ÄòReaction to Fire‚Äô tests that cover key characteristics. Only insulation materials with the highest reaction to fire classification, known as Euroclass A1 or A2-s1,d0,  can be considered as non-combustible.That gets a little technical, but it does boil down to a simple reality: combustible materials burn, non-combustible ones don‚Äôt. Stone wool insulation is in this latter, non-combustible category. What's more, if our stone wool insulation is exposed to fire, it won‚Äôt emit significant amounts of toxic smoke. That matters because toxic smoke is actually the leading cause of fatalities in building fires.Combustible materials, on the other hand, are a potential source of fuel as they can be ignited and burn during a fire event ‚Äì even with the addition of chemical flame retardants. And if they do catch fire, combustible materials will contribute to the fire‚Äôs spread and intensity. It‚Äôs one choice that affects the lives of many people.We make choices every day based on risks to our own safety, like wearing a seatbelt when we drive or teaching our children to cross the road only at the zebra crossing. But choosing between combustible or non-combustible building materials for a building is different ‚Äì it‚Äôs a choice on behalf of many people today and in the future.Check out our latest blog by ROCKWOOL SVP @mirellaamaliavitale to learn more about creating safer homes and buildings:https://fal.cn/3uouU",0

"Planting trees is the most widely understood climate solution. As a tree grows, it removes carbon from the atmosphere through the natural process of photosynthesis.To reverse the trend of global tree cover loss, reforestation and afforestation efforts are critical to restoring our natural world.For example, the Mississippi Valley reforestation projects aim to reforest one million acres in an area that was once covered by nearly 10 million hectares of dense forest.Sustained deforestation and agricultural land use conversion caused over 75% of the forest cover has been lost. Landowners who voluntarily enroll in the project commit to planting and protecting trees, reducing nearly 100 tonnes CO2 equivalent per hectare.https://lnkd.in/esWcwxFd #climateaction #netzero #netzeroby2050 #carbonneutral #climatechange #sustainability #environment #climate #sustainable #sustainabledevelopmentgoals #project",1

"Hear first hand from one of our client‚Äôs constructors on how quickly, efficiently, and safely our modules get installed once delivered on-site.The Modular Ammonia Recovery System shown consisted of 3 process modules and one stair tower. Aside from coming together smoothly onsite without a hitch during installation, what also made this project a success was that this project was kicked off just prior to COVID-19 taking the world by storm and impacting how most EPC‚Äôs traditionally delivered projects.While many construction sites were coping with managing the spread of infection across the site‚Äôs workforce,  Koch Modular  was able to mitigate COVID-19 exposure by reducing the likelihood of exposure by keeping construction away from the construction site and shifting it to smaller and regional offsite fabrication and module assembly shops less impacted by COVID-19.This was not a new strategy for Koch Modular and considered business as usual since all our projects are delivered modularly. Therefore, Koch Modular was ultimately able to maintain project schedule through engineering, fabrication, module assembly, and delivery without any illness or incident. Congratulations to the project team and all the contractors and vendors involved who worked hard to make this project a success during a surprising and difficult period never witnessed before.

"E-Mobility Insights: It is exciting to see a new dynamic in Europe. The distinct commitment to electro mobility is leading to numerous innovations and investments. On the road to e-mobility, the battery system is becoming a decisive factor: It accounts for around 50 percent of the total costs in the electric powertrain. And of these, the battery cell accounts for around 70 percent of the costs. Europe has the opportunity to develop cell production capabilities in addition to battery module and battery pack production. But China currently has a market advantage in cell production, not least thanks to subsidies. If the European automotive industry likes to remain competitive, we need to build a European ecosystem for the development and production of sustainable battery cells. The European engineering association VDMA has requested clear actions from politics and creation of fair market conditions. We need a New Deal that enables OEMs, suppliers and machine builders to work in partnership towards a common goal: Establishing self-sufficient, sustainable battery cell production in Europe.Learn more about our battery production expertise here:https://lnkd.in/ds7wwDev #EMobility #electromobility #batteryproduction #batteryproductioninEurope # VDMA  #OEM #suppliers",1
